Title - ANTI-COLLISION SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR VEHICLES AT RAILROAD CROSSINGS 

Abstract: 
An active method, following the guidelines of MISRA C, for autonomous emergency braking system in automobiles/vehicles for enhanced prevention of the train's collision with the automobiles at level crossings has been developed which includes detection of approaching train/locomotive by sensing the vibrations on the railway track by an accelerometer; sending the same vibrations' data to a track control unit where the sensed data is compared with a train's general vibrations pattern; activating a RF transmitter which continuously transmits/broadcast the warning signal to the incoming automobiles; initiating the braking operation in conjunction with/without ABS unit to stop the vehicle before a critical distance from the crossing. Thus, collision is avoided every time at the level crossing even in the absence of driver's attention. 
Modules and components used for building POC were accelerometer ADXL 335, 40kg strain-gauge type load cell, linear actuator with stroke of 70mm, actuator driving circuit (IC 7812, IC L293D), 24V motor, motor driving circuit (Pololu 24v21/relay circuit), 2.4GHz (ISM) RF transceiver modules (STM8+NRF24L01+), microcontroller boards (Arduino UNO), batteries and hydraulic braking unit.
